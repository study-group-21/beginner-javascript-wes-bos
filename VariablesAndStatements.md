# Variables and Statements (Module 1: The Basics)

3 Types of JS variables:
* var
* let
* const

statement = instruction to the computer

statement ex: const cool = true;
* For a statement "const cool = true; " is the statement

semicolon ; always ends statements

don't have to use semicolons but industry standard to do so

can update the values of var and let after they're declared but not const

var is function scoped and let and const are block scoped

let and const were introduced in ES6

Wes' Rules:
* use const by default
* if need to change the value, change it to let
* rarely use var


Variables should be lower case

ex: const dog = cat

camel case is allowed in JavaScript and industry standard

ex: const iLovePizza = true;
